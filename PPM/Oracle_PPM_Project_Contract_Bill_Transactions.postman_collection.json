The possible values for RangeMode are SET_LOGICAL_START, SET_LOGICAL_END, END_DATE, SET_EFFECTIVE_START, SET_EFFECTIVE_END, REPLACE_CORRECTION, REPLACE_UPDATE, RECONCILE_CORRECTION, CORRECTION, RECONCILE_UPDATE, UPDATE, ZAP and DELETE_CHANGES. The possible values for RangeSpan are PHYSICAL_ROW_END_DATE and LOGICAL_ROW_END_DATE. The values for RangeStartDate and RangeEndDate have to be a string representation of a date in yyyy-MM-dd format. The value for RangeStartSequence and RangeEndSequence must be strings such that when parsed they yield positive integers."

Bill transactions are the smallest unit of transactional detail that can appear on a customer invoice, and are a record of the project, product or service-related line items to be billed. Each bill transaction has a bill quantity, a unit of measure (which provides context to the bill quantity), a unit price and an amount to be billed. When invoicing and revenue generation are both based on the same source transaction, bill transactions record both invoice and revenue measures on a single transaction, unifying the two processes. The history of invoicing and revenue generation for a bill transaction is tracked through related invoice distribution lines and revenue distribution lines respectively."
