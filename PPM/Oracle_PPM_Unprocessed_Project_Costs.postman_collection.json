The possible values for RangeMode are SET_LOGICAL_START, SET_LOGICAL_END, END_DATE, SET_EFFECTIVE_START, SET_EFFECTIVE_END, REPLACE_CORRECTION, REPLACE_UPDATE, RECONCILE_CORRECTION, CORRECTION, RECONCILE_UPDATE, UPDATE, ZAP and DELETE_CHANGES. The possible values for RangeSpan are PHYSICAL_ROW_END_DATE and LOGICAL_ROW_END_DATE. The values for RangeStartDate and RangeEndDate have to be a string representation of a date in yyyy-MM-dd format. The value for RangeStartSequence and RangeEndSequence must be strings such that when parsed they yield positive integers."
