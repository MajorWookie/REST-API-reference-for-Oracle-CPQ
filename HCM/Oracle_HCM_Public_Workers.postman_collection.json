If both are provided, only fields will be considered.<br><br>Format: ?fields=Attribute1,Attribute2<br><br>Format for fields in child resource: ?fields=Accessor1:Attribute1,Attribute2",

If a nested child is provided (Example: Employees.Managers), the missing children will be processed implicitly. For example, \"?expand=Employees.Managers\" is the same as \"?expand=Employees,Employees.Managers\" (which will expand Employees and Managers).",
