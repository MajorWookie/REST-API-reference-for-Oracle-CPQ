If an indirect child resource is provided (Example: Employees.Managers), the missing children will be processed implicitly. For example, \"?fields=Employees.Managers:Empname\" is the same as \"?fields=;Employees:;Employees.Managers:Empname\" (which will only return the \"Empname\" field for Managers). the value of this query parameter is a list of resource fields. The attribute can be a direct (Example: Employees) or indirect (Example: Employees.Managers) child. It cannot be combined with expand query parameter.

The possible values for RangeMode are SET_LOGICAL_START, SET_LOGICAL_END, END_DATE, SET_EFFECTIVE_START, SET_EFFECTIVE_END, REPLACE_CORRECTION, REPLACE_UPDATE, RECONCILE_CORRECTION, CORRECTION, RECONCILE_UPDATE, UPDATE, ZAP and DELETE_CHANGES. The possible values for RangeSpan are PHYSICAL_ROW_END_DATE and LOGICAL_ROW_END_DATE. The values for RangeStartDate and RangeEndDate have to be a string representation of a date in yyyy-MM-dd format. The value for RangeStartSequence and RangeEndSequence must be strings such that when parsed they yield positive integers."

Only the specified fields are returned, which means that if no fields are specified, no fields are returned (useful to get only the links). If an indirect child resource is provided (Example: Employees.Managers), the missing children will be processed implicitly. For example, \"?fields=Employees.Managers:Empname\" is the same as \"?fields=;Employees:;Employees.Managers:Empname\" (which will only return the \"Empname\" field for Managers). the value of this query parameter is a list of resource fields. The attribute can be a direct (Example: Employees) or indirect (Example: Employees.Managers) child. It cannot be combined with expand query parameter. If both are provided, only fields will be considered.<br><br>Format: ?fields=Attribute1,Attribute2<br><br>Format for fields in child resource: ?fields=Accessor1:Attribute1,Attribute2",

The value of this query parameter is a set of dependency fields.  Example: dependency=ProductId=2<br><br>Format: &lt;attr1&gt;=&lt;val1&gt;,&lt;attr2&gt;=&lt;value2&gt;",
