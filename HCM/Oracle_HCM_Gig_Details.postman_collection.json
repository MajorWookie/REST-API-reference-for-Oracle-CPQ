The value of this query parameter is a set of dependency fields.  Example: dependency=ProductId=2<br><br>Format: &lt;attr1&gt;=&lt;val1&gt;,&lt;attr2&gt;=&lt;value2&gt;",

If a nested child is provided (Example: Employees.Managers), the missing children will be processed implicitly. For example, \"?expand=Employees.Managers\" is the same as \"?expand=Employees,Employees.Managers\" (which will expand Employees and Managers).",

For example, \"?fields=Employees.Managers:Empname\" is the same as \"?fields=;Employees:;Employees.Managers:Empname\" (which will only return the \"Empname\" field for Managers). the value of this query parameter is a list of resource fields. The attribute can be a direct (Example: Employees) or indirect (Example: Employees.Managers) child. It cannot be combined with expand query parameter. If both are provided, only fields will be considered.<br><br>Format: ?fields=Attribute1,Attribute2<br><br>Format for fields in child resource: ?fields=Accessor1:Attribute1,Attribute2",
