The default value is ORA_CN_NOT_READY which indicates the simulation shouldn't run when the resource is created or updated. ORA_CN_READY indicates that the calculation simulation process must be executed when the resource is created or updated. Value ORA_CN_SCHEDULE means the calculation simulation process is ready to be scheduled to run as an asynchronous job. The simulation process will change the processing status to ORA_CN_STARTED while the simulation runs, and move it to a terminal state once it ends. Terminal states are ORA_CN_COMPLETE for successful execution, ORA_CN_WARNING if some of the simulation credits were processed but others ended in error, and ORA_CN_ERROR if no simulation credits were processed due to errors. If the status ends in ORA_CN_WARNING or ORA_CN_ERROR use ErrorCode field to identify the type of error.

Use value  ORA_CN_ESTIMATION_LIMITED to limit the estimated earnings to only the next payment period based on the plan component's payout frequency. For example - for a plan component with a quarterly payout frequency but having annual performance measures, if you are estimating a transaction in Q2, using ORA_CN_ESTIMATION in simulation type will return estimated earning results for Q1, Q2, Q3 and Q4. However using ORA_CN_ESTIMATION_LIMITED will return results for just Q2 and also estimate faster.</li><li>StartPayPeriodId; integer; The lowest pay period id for the earnings in this calculation simulation.</li></ul>",

If there are simulation earnings in error, or no simulation earnings at all this value will move to ORA_CN_SETUP.

The default value is ORA_CN_NOT_READY which indicates the simulation shouldn't run when the resource is created or updated. ORA_CN_READY indicates that the calculation simulation process must be executed when the resource is created or updated. Value ORA_CN_SCHEDULE means the calculation simulation process is ready to be scheduled to run as an asynchronous job. The simulation process will change the processing status to ORA_CN_STARTED while the simulation runs, and move it to a terminal state once it ends. Terminal states are ORA_CN_COMPLETE for successful execution, ORA_CN_WARNING if some of the simulation credits were processed but others ended in error, and ORA_CN_ERROR if no simulation credits were processed due to errors. If the status ends in ORA_CN_WARNING or ORA_CN_ERROR use ErrorCode field to identify the type of error.

Use value  ORA_CN_ESTIMATION_LIMITED to limit the estimated earnings to only the next payment period based on the plan component's payout frequency. For example - for a plan component with a quarterly payout frequency but having annual performance measures, if you are estimating a transaction in Q2, using ORA_CN_ESTIMATION in simulation type will return estimated earning results for Q1, Q2, Q3 and Q4. However using ORA_CN_ESTIMATION_LIMITED will return results for just Q2 and also estimate faster.</li><li>StartPayPeriodId; integer; The lowest pay period id for the earnings in this calculation simulation.</li></ul>",

To allow rollup credit processing, enter R. The last two letters indicate earnings edibility and calculation. Valid values are EC, EN,NN, and NC. Enter a code with the value of N in either or both of the fourth and fifth position to exclude the credit from calculation.
