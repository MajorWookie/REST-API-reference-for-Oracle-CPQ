Only the specified fields are returned, which means that if no fields are specified, no fields are returned (useful to get only the links). If an indirect child resource is provided (Example: Employees.Managers), the missing children will be processed implicitly. For example, \"?fields=Employees.Managers:Empname\" is the same as \"?fields=;Employees:;Employees.Managers:Empname\" (which will only return the \"Empname\" field for Managers). the value of this query parameter is a list of resource fields. The attribute can be a direct (Example: Employees) or indirect (Example: Employees.Managers) child. It cannot be combined with expand query parameter. If both are provided, only fields will be considered.<br><br>Format: ?fields=Attribute1,Attribute2<br><br>Format for fields in child resource: ?fields=Accessor1:Attribute1,Attribute2",
