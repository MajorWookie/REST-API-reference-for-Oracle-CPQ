When a new approved supplier list entry is created, a supplier item attribute record with the same scope as the approved supplier entry is also created. However, ship-to organization-specific supplier item attributes can't be added to approved supplier list entries with global scope. Additionally, approved supplier list entries of category type or those of manufacturer or distributor business types can't be created, updated, or retrieved using the REST API."
