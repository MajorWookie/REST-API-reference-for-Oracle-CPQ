If the activity duration key is modified, then the overrides for that key are deleted from the application. However, the overrides persist if another activity duration key is active, with the old key in the application being inactive state. If the inactive key is set to active again, the overrides that were set corresponding to that key become applicable for the duration estimates.</p><p>For the activity duration key that is currently active, the override value is stored in the application along with the statistically learned value. For activity duration estimates, if an override is specified, then the override value is used instead of the statistically learned value. However, the statistically learned value is updated based on the new durations reported. At any point of time, it is possible to stop using the overrides by importing the data again with value 0 in the 'override' field. In such cases, the application starts using the statistically learned value for the duration estimates.

For travel duration estimates, if an override is specified, then the override value is used instead of the statistically learned value. However, the statistically learned value is kept updated based on new reported durations. At any point of time, it is possible to stop using the overrides by importing the data again with value 0 in the 'override' field. In such cases, the application starts using the statistically learned value for duration estimates.
