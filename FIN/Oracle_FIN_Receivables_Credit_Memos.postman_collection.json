If a nested child is provided (Example: Employees.Managers), the missing children will be processed implicitly. For example, \"?expand=Employees.Managers\" is the same as \"?expand=Employees,Employees.Managers\" (which will expand Employees and Managers).",

When a child resource collection is requested and the parameter is set, the fields will be set in the parent resource instance before generating the resource collection payload. The value of this query parameter is a set of dependency fields.  Example: dependency=ProductId=2<br><br>Format: &lt;attr1&gt;=&lt;val1&gt;,&lt;attr2&gt;=&lt;value2&gt;",
