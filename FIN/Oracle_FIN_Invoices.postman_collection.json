In summary, the cascade defaulting doesn't automatically happen and you must review and update the dependent attributes.\n\nFor example, when you update the invoice date in the Create or Edit Invoice pages, related fields, such as the terms date or due date, may be autopopulated based on the invoice date you enter. Using REST API, the invoice date is updated, but the related fields aren't autopopulated. Before updating a key attribute, consider the impact on the related attributes."
